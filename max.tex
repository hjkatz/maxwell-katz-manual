\section{Introduction}

So, you've been wrangled into babysitting a dog. Not just any dog though, Max.
\emph{Sigh.} What are you going to do? Maxwell Katz is a rambunctious,
destructive, incorrigible goofball, yet he will tug at your heartstrings with
his lovable face and ears. What should you do? What does he eat? What does he
do for fun? What should I do in the case of emergency?! \emph{Oh no!} This may
seem like a lot to handle, but fear not, all of this and more will be answered
in the manual.

\section{Schedule}

Maxwell's schedule is extremely rigorous, and must be kept with the up most
scrutiny. He requires attention literally 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and
without this given to him, I fear he may become deprived, depressed, or
worse\ldots dead. Below is his main schedule for a normal week, keep in mind that
Maxwell is crate trained. His crate is a safe zone--a home away from home. Feel
free to place Max in his crate whenever he becomes too much of a hazard.

\subsection{Schedule Description}
\begin{itemize}\label{itm:schedule}
    \item \textbf{Sleeping:} Max's sleeping schedule is pretty lax. He sleeps 
        quite often, and is adorable the entire time. Keep in mind the following:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Crating Max for sleep time is OK
            \item Max can be petted while he is asleep
            \item Max sheds, so be aware of letting him on the bed or furniture
            \item Max sleeps in peculiar ways, this is OK
                (See Fig~\ref{fig:sleeping} on page~\pageref{fig:sleeping})
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Walks:} Walking Max is no longer a chore! He has recently been fitted
        with a remote control device (See Section~\ref{sec:collar} on page \pageref{sec:collar}).
        He is now super easy to walk and let outside to use the bathroom.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Walks can be as short as 30 secs, or as long as 30 mins
            \item Some walks are pee, some poop, some both
                (See Table~\ref{tab:schedule} on page~\pageref{tab:schedule})
            \item Maxwell is trained to go to the bathroom on command
                (See Table~\ref{tab:commands} on page~\pageref{tab:commands})
            \item Always walk Max on a leash if you are not comfortable with the remote control commands.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Feeding:} Maxwell eats twice a day, once in the morning and
        once in the evening. He also receives water during each meal.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Each meal consists of 1 cup of dog food
                (See Fig~\ref{fig:food_bowl_filled} on
                page~\pageref{fig:food_bowl_filled})
            \item Max is trained to wait until eating
                (See Fig~\ref{fig:food_container_open} on
                page~\pageref{fig:food_container_open})
            \item Max eats fast, and he should be walked after dinner
            \item Sometimes Max doesn't eat breakfast, sometimes he doesn't eat dinner too.
                This is OK, he will eventually eat, don't fret.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Play Time:} Max loves to play! His favorite game is tug-of-war.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Max comes with a plethora of toys
                (See List~\ref{itm:included_items} on
                page~\pageref{itm:included_items})
            \item Max loves to play in the dirt and mud
            \item Max is very energetic; you have been warned
                (See Fig~\ref{fig:at_the_park} on
                page~\pageref{fig:at_the_park})

Here is a list of all of the items that you will receive for watching Maxwell.
Most of it will be in his bag. You will not need to use all of these items, and

\section{Electric Collar} \label{sec:collar}

Max has gone through professional e-collar training to become off leash
reliable. Please make use of his e-collar throughout his stay. You don't have
to use the remote control with his commands or on walks, but please have the
collar on him at least.

\subsection{Questions about the e-collar}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Does the collar hurt Max?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item No. Even though it is an electric charge, the ``shock'' does
                not ``hurt''. It's more like a TENS unit and contracts the
                muscles around his neck.
            \item I've used it on my wrists before and it is not ``bad'' just
                a different feeling that Max understands as ``pay attention''.
        \end{itemize}
    \item How high should the remote be set to?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It depends on how destructing the environment is. If it's
                just Max and me I usually work in the 15-25 range. If we're at
                the dog park I'll work at 35-50 range. If Max is running off
                into the distance chasing a cat I'll set it to the 70-90
                range.
            \item If Max whimpers at the shock don't worry. He's just being a
                baby. Make sure you \textbf{keep the shock going} until he
                responds, even in this case.
        \end{itemize}
    \item What should I do if Max doesn't respond to my command?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Turn the ``volume'' up on the remote and keep calling him.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How to use the e-collar}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Turning it On:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The \textbf{remote control} is turned on by holding
                down the black button on the back until the screen turns on.
            \item The \textbf{e-collar} has a little red dot which is magnetic. The
                remote has the same. Touch these two together and the collar
                will light up green.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Turning it Off/Charging:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In general I don't turn the collar or remote off because
                they automatically turn off while charging.
            \item The charging cables plug into the back of both devices.
                Simply open up the water proof seal and plug them in.
            \item The devices will be red while charging and green when
                charged.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Putting the Collar On:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Make sure that the collar and remote are both on.
            \item Put the e-collar around Max's neck in-front of his leash
                collar.
            \item Hook the e-collar at 2 holes first, then have Max look up
                and slide the e-collar back around his neck fat.
            \item Tighten the e-collar to 4-5 holes.
            \item You should be able to put 4 fingers in between the collar
                and Max's neck, but it should be a tight fit.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{E-Collar Commands:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Some commands are special and have been associated with the
                e-collar stimulation. In general these commands will have you
                \textbf{hold down} the red stimulate button until Max performs
                a certain action, then you will release it.
            \item His command table will have instructions on e-collar use.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Commands}

This section is all about how to speak to Max. You need to be commanding yet
attentive to his mood. Like all animals, he demands respect, and misbehaves like
a child would. He will always listen to commands better with a treat/toy in
hand. Maxwell has also been trained to listen for whistling, any command can be
prefaced with a short loop-de-loop whistle to make him pay attention. Some
commands require e-collar stimulation for better performance.

\section{Rewards and Discipline}

Maxwell is always learning, and like a child he is impressionable. Please keep
in mind that by accepting to watch Max that you will be expected to continue his
training and discipline. This is not a big undertaking. 

\bigskip

Training Max is really easy and will mostly be done without a second thought.
Basically when he does something good, you praise him. And when he disobeys, you
discipline him. Praise can be in the form of treats, pets, "Good boy", and
generally loving him. Discipline can be in the form of "Eh", "No", "Bad dog",
angry eyes, and crating. 

\bigskip

Basic training to keep up with his behavior involves sit, down, wait, come
here, and release. A basic rule of thumb is that whenever Max is going to be
rewarded, train him first. This keeps him respectful of you, and entertains him
as his breed likes to please and be challenged. When you feed him, make him sit,
then release for feeding. When you play fetch, make him sit, or down, or stay
before throwing his toy. When you enter or leave a doorway, make him sit and
wait for the door to be opened. And further training is not out of the question.
Feel free to teach him new tricks!

\bigskip

Discipline is a bit different. He will misbehave, and when he does, he must be
told. Use "Eh" and "Uh-uh" frequently. "No" and "Bad dog" should only be used
for very bad behaviours that include chewing furniture, chewing shoes, accidents
in the house, etc\ldots Below is a non-comprehensive list of what to do in
various situations.

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}\label{itm:discipline}
    \item \textbf{Accident Indoors:} If Max has an accident inside the house,
        wait till he has finished going, then feel free to yell! Shout "No!
        Bad Dog!". Then drag him by his collar to his crate. Keep him in
        timeout for approx. 20 mins.
    \item \textbf{Baring Teeth / Nipping:} If he bares his teeth or nips at you,
        firmly state "No". Then avoid eye contact.
    \item \textbf{Barking:} Firmly state "No bark." Then place him on his cot
        using the e-collar. If he continues, just ignore him. He will
        eventually stop and laydown.
    \item \textbf{Biting:} If Max bites you or anyone else or anything else,
        shout "No bite!". Then kneel down and hold his mouth closed while
        maintaining eye contact. Keep a firm, yet non-squeezing grip until he
        pulls away. (Note: he might whine, this is OK)
    \item \textbf{Causing Pain:} If Maxwell truly causes you pain through a
        bite, scratch, tackle, or otherwise, shout "ouch!". This will let
        him know that he has been playing too rough, or hurt you in some way.
        Normally after this I calm him down and give him something to chew on.
    \item \textbf{Chewing:} When (not if) you catch him chewing on something he
        shouldn't be chewing, state "No bite". Then give him a toy he can chew
        on. Remember that you can always use the bitter spray to keep him from
        gnawing on furniture, cords, and the like. (See List~\ref{itm:included_items} on
        page~\pageref{itm:included_items})
    \item \textbf{Eating Something:} Again, when you catch him eating something
        he shouldn't be eating, shout "Eh". Then try the command "Drop it" (See
        Table~\ref{tab:commands} on page~\pageref{tab:commands}). If that
        doesn't work, open his mouth and remove the item.
    \item \textbf{Growling:} Calm him down with petting and a soothing "shhhh".
    \item \textbf{Jumping/Rowdy:} Place him on his cot or in his crate.
    \item \textbf{Playing Rough:} If Max is playing rough when he should be
        calming down, follow the above. Get him to lay down, then pet him and
        soothe him with a "shhhh".
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

This is not an exhaustive list by any means. Generally a firm "Eh" and a stern
voice with a look of disapproval will fix a problem temporarily. Remember that
you can always put him away in his crate as both punishment and nap time. If you
have any major problems please feel free to call, text, or email me.
(See Table~\ref{tab:information} on page~\pageref{tab:information})

\section{How to\ldots}

This section contains various instructions on how to care for Max. Each item has
a list of what you should do in this situation. Pictures are provided as a
continence. Should you have any other questions or concerns, please contact me.
(See Table~\ref{tab:information} on page~\pageref{tab:information})

\subsection{How to feed Max}
\begin{enumerate}\label{itm:how_to_feed}
    \item Fill his water bowl $\frac{3}{4}$ way up with cold tap water
    \item Open the food container top (See Fig~\ref{fig:food_container_open})
    \item Fill his food bowl with 1 cup of food (See Fig~\ref{fig:food_bowl_filled})
    \item Release Max to eat
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\subsection{How to walk Max}
\begin{enumerate}\label{itm:how_to_walk}
    \item Call Maxwell to the door saying, "Let's go outside!"
    \item Get Maxwell to sit, waiting
    \item Go outside, while walking keep Max close by or in heel with his
        e-collar.
    \item If you're using the leash it should be loose.
    \item Maxwell should always walk on your left side. Heel him or correct
        him if he's on the wrong side.
    \item Don't let him lollygag. Use heel strictly to get him in place while
        walking.
    \item You can release him to let him run off and explore, but be sure to
        call him back with the e-collar before returning to heel.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{How to clean up an accident}
\begin{enumerate}\label{itm:how_to_clean_accident}
    \item Identify the spot where Max has gone
    \item Mark off the area, and put Max away
    \item Get the peepee solution, and paper towels from his bag
    \item Get a trashcan or other receptacle for the soaked paper towels
    \item Soak up the accident with the paper towels (note: this will be disgusting)
    \item When the paper towels come away "generally" dry, open the peepee solution to "spray"
    \item Spray the solution around the area so that it soaks into the carpet
    \item Let sit for 3-5 minutes
    \item Scrub the solution into the carpet with paper towels
    \item Soak up the excess solution with paper towels
    \item Repeat as necessary
\end{enumerate}
