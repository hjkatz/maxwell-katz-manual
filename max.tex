\section{Introduction}

So, you've been wrangled into babysitting a dog. Not just any dog though, Max.
\emph{Sigh.} What are you going to do? Maxwell Katz is a rambunctious,
destructive, incorrigible goofball, yet he will tug at your heartstrings with
his lovable face and ears. What should you do? What does he eat? What does he
do for fun? What should I do in the case of emergency?! \emph{Oh no!} This may
seem like a lot to handle, but fear not, all of this and more will be answered
in the manual.

\section{Schedule}

Maxwell's schedule is extremely rigorous, and must be kept with the up most
scrutiny. He requires attention literally 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and
without this given to him, I fear he may become deprived, depressed, or
worse\ldots dead. Below is his main schedule for a normal week, keep in mind that
Maxwell is crate trained. His crate is a safe zone--a home away from home. Feel
free to place Max in his crate whenever he becomes too much of a hazard.

\subsection{Schedule Description}
\begin{itemize}\label{itm:schedule}
    \item \textbf{Sleeping:} Max's sleeping schedule is pretty lax. He sleeps 
        quite often, and is adorable the entire time. Keep in mind the following:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Crating Max for sleep time is OK
            \item Max can be petted while he is asleep
            \item Max sheds, so be aware of letting him on the bed or furniture
            \item Max sleeps in peculiar ways, this is OK
                (See Fig~\ref{fig:sleeping} on page~\pageref{fig:sleeping})
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Walks:} Walking Max is a fun adventure. He is VERY strong so I
        advise using his gentle leader collar. See how to put on the Gentle Leader
        on page~\pageref{itm:how_to_gentle_leader}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Walks can be as short as 30 secs, or as long as 30 mins
            \item Some walks are pee, some poop, some both
                (See Table~\ref{tab:schedule} on page~\pageref{tab:schedule})
            \item Maxwell is trained to go to the bathroom on command
                (See Table~\ref{tab:commands} on page~\pageref{tab:commands})
            \item Always walk Max on a leash
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Feeding:} Maxwell eats twice a day, once in the morning and
        once in the evening. He also receives water during each meal.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Each meal consists of 1 cup of dog food
                (See Fig~\ref{fig:food_bowl_filled} on
                page~\pageref{fig:food_bowl_filled})
            \item Max is trained to wait until eating
                (See Fig~\ref{fig:food_container_open} on
                page~\pageref{fig:food_container_open})
            \item Max eats fast, and he must be walked immediately after dinner
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Play Time:} Max loves to play! He plays ball, tug of war, chew
        the shoes, eat the garbage, and lots more\ldots!
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Max comes with a plethora of toys
                (See List~\ref{itm:included_items} on
                page~\pageref{itm:included_items})
            \item Max loves to play in the dirt and mud
            \item Max is very energetic; you have been warned
                (See Fig~\ref{fig:at_the_park} on
                page~\pageref{fig:at_the_park})

\section{Included Items}

Here is a list of all of the items that you will receive for watching Maxwell.
Most of it will be in his bag. You will not need to use all of these items, and
don't worry if things get lost. In all honesty Max will probably find a toy to
take home, and one to leave there.

    \item Maxwell Katz
    \item Crate Items
        \begin{enumerate}

        \end{enumerate}
    \item Max's Bag
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Treats

    \item Food Container
    \item Leash
    \item Gentle Leader Collar
\end{enumerate}

\section{Commands}

This section is all about how to speak to Max. You need to be commanding yet
attentive to his mood. Like all animals, he demands respect, and misbehaves like
a child would. He will always listen to commands better with a treat/toy in
hand. Maxwell has also been trained to listen for whistling, any command can be
prefaced with a short loop-de-loop whistle to make him pay attention.

\section{Rewards and Discipline}

Maxwell is always learning, and like a child he is impressionable. Please keep
in mind that by accepting to watch Max that you will be expected to continue his
training and discipline. This is not a big undertaking. 

\bigskip

Training Max is really easy and will mostly be done without a second thought.
Basically when he does something good, you praise him. And when he disobeys, you
discipline him. Praise can be in the form of treats, pets, "Good boy", and
generally loving him. Discipline can be in the form of "Eh", "No", "Bad dog",
angry eyes, and crating. 

\bigskip

Basic training to keep up with his behavior involves sit, down, wait, come
here, and release. A basic rule of thumb is that whenever Max is going to be
rewarded, train him first. This keeps him respectful of you, and entertains him
as his breed likes to please and be challenged. When you feed him, make him sit,
then release for feeding. When you play fetch, make him sit, or down, or stay
before throwing his toy. When you enter or leave a doorway, make him sit and
wait for the door to be opened. And further training is not out of the question.
Feel free to teach him new tricks!

\bigskip

Discipline is a bit different. He will misbehave, and when he does, he must be
told. Use "Eh" and "Uh-uh" frequently. "No" and "Bad dog" should only be used
for very bad behaviours that include chewing furniture, chewing shoes, accidents
in the house, etc\ldots Below is a non-comprehensive list of what to do in
various situations.

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}\label{itm:discipline}
    \item \textbf{Accident Indoors:} If Max has an accident inside the house,
        wait till he has finished going, then feel free to yell! Shout "NO!
        Bad Dog!". Then drag him by his collar to his crate. Keep him in
        timeout for approx. 20 mins.
    \item \textbf{Baring Teeth / Nipping:} If he bares his teeth or nips at you,
        firmly state "No". Then avoid eye contact.
    \item \textbf{Barking:} Firmly state "No bark." Then soothe him with a calm
        "shhhhh". If he continues, get him to sit. Then pet him and hold one
        hand under his chin while putting pressure on his vocal chords.
    \item \textbf{Biting:} If Max bites you or anyone else or anything else,
        shout "No bite!". Then kneel down and hold his mouth closed while
        maintaining eye contact. Keep a firm, yet non-squeezing grip until he
        pulls away. (Note: he might whine, this is OK)
    \item \textbf{Causing Pain:} If Maxwell truly causes you pain through a
        bite, scratch, tackle, or otherwise, shout "ouch!". This will let
        him know that he has been playing too rough, or hurt you in some way.
        Normally after this I calm him down and give him something to chew on.
    \item \textbf{Chewing:} When (not if) you catch him chewing on something he
        shouldn't be chewing, state "No bite". Then give him a toy he can chew
        on. Remember that you can always use the bitter spray to keep him from
        gnawing on furniture, cords, and the like. (See List~\ref{itm:included_items} on
        page~\pageref{itm:included_items})
    \item \textbf{Eating Something:} Again, when you catch him eating something
        he shouldn't be eating, shout "Eh". Then try the command "Drop it" (See
        Table~\ref{tab:commands} on page~\pageref{tab:commands}). If that
        doesn't work, open his mouth and remove the item.
    \item \textbf{Growling:} Calm him down with petting and a soothing "shhhh".
    \item \textbf{Jumping/Rowdy:} Put his Gentle Leader Collar on to calm him
        down. (See page~\pageref{itm:how_to_gentle_leader})
    \item \textbf{Playing Rough:} If Max is playing rough when he should be
        calming down, follow the above. Get him to lay down, then pet him and
        soothe him with a "shhhh".
    \item \textbf{Refusing to Listen:} Get a treat.
    \item \textbf{Refusing to Walk:} Use a firm tug with a firm "Eh".
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

This is not an exhaustive list by any means. Generally a firm "Eh" and a stern
voice with a look of disapproval will fix a problem temporarily. Remember that
you can always put him away in his crate as both punishment and nap time. If you
have any major problems please feel free to call, text, or email me.
(See Table~\ref{tab:information} on page~\pageref{tab:information})

    \item Call Maxwell to the door saying, "Let's go outside!"
    \item Get Maxwell to sit, waiting
    \item Put the Gentle Leader Collar and leash on Max
    \item Go outside, while walking keep Max on a short leash
        (See Fig~\ref{fig:walking_max})
    \item It should be loose, yet ready to tug
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{How to clean up an accident}
\begin{enumerate}\label{itm:how_to_clean_accident}
    \item Identify the spot where Max has gone
    \item Mark off the area, and put Max away
    \item Get the peepee solution, and paper towels from his bag
    \item Get a trashcan or other receptacle for the soaked paper towels
    \item Soak up the accident with the paper towels (note: this will be disgusting)
    \item When the paper towels come away "generally" dry, open the peepee solution to "spray"
    \item Spray the solution around the area so that it soaks into the carpet
    \item Let sit for 3-5 minutes
    \item Scrub the solution into the carpet with paper towels
    \item Soak up the excess solution with paper towels
    \item Repeat as necessary
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{How to put on the Gentle Leader Collar \& Leash}
\begin{enumerate}\label{itm:how_to_gentle_leader}
    \item See Fig~\ref{fig:gentle_leader_steps} on page~\pageref{fig:gentle_leader_steps}.
    \item Place the collar on the floor with the dark towards you, and
        the light side towards Max.
    \item Connect the dark band around Max's neck and chest, attaching the clasp
        in the back behind his shoulders.
    \item Run the light side underneath Max's underside and attach the clasp to
        on Max's right side shoulder.
    \item Attach the leash to the front ring on Max's chest.
    \item When walking Max with this collar, maintain a loose leash.
    \item Make sure the collar is snug and secure.
    \item Make sure that the collar' "O" rings reside on Max's shoulders where
        his legs connect to his body.
