\section{Introduction}

So, you've been wrangled into babysitting a dog. Not just any dog though, Max.
\emph{Sigh.} What are you going to do? Maxwell Katz (no middle name) is a
rambunctions, destructive, incorrigible goofball, yet he will tug at your
heartstrings with his lovable face and ears. What should you do? What does he
eat? \emph{Oh no!} What does he do for fun? What should I do in the case of
emergency? This may seem like a lot to handle, but fear not, all of this and
more will be answered in this manual.

\section{Schedule}

Maxwell's schedule is extremely rigourous, and must be kept with the up most
scrutiny. He requires attention literally 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and
without this given to him, I fear he may become deprived, depressed, or
worse...dead. Below is his main schedule for a normal week, keep in mind that
Maxwell is crate trained. His crate is a safe zone, a home away from home. Feel
free to place Max in his crate whenever he becomes too much of a hazard.

As you should be able to tell by now, this is a sarcastic document. I hope that
you read the whole file, although all the basic information will be presented in
tables and lists. Below you will find a descriptive list of Max's rituals.
\\

\begin{itemize}\label{itm:schedule}
    \item \textbf{Sleeping:} Max's sleeping schedule is pretty lax. He sleeps 
        quite often, and is adorable the entire time. Keep in mind the following:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Crating Max for sleep time is OK
            \item Max can be petted while he is asleep
            \item Max sheds, so be aware of letting him on the bed
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Walks:} Walking Max is a fun adventure. He is learning that he
        is strong, and WILL PULL. He has a special leash that can be used if he 
        gets out of hand. See \todo{add reference for special harness}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Walks can be as short as 30 secs, or as long as 30 mins
            \item Some walks are pee, some poop, some both
                  (See Table~\ref{tab:schedule} on page~\pageref{tab:schedule})
            \item Maxwell is trained to go to the bathroom on command
                  (See \todo{insert reference to commands})
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Feeding:} Maxwell eats twice a day, once in the morning and
        once in the evening. He also receives water during each meal.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Each meal consists of 1.5 cups of dog food
            \item Max is trained to wait til eating
                  (See \todo{insert reference to commands})
            \item Max eats fast, and he must be walked immediatly after dinner
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Play Time:} Max loves to play! He plays ball, tug of war, chew
        the shoes, eat the garbage, and lots more\ldots!
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Max comes with a plethera of toys
                  (See \todo{insert reference to Max items})
            \item Max is very energetic, you have been warned
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
